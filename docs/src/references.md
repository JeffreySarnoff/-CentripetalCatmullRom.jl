#### Images appearing the documentation 

The comparison of the three standard parameterizations of the Catmull-Rom cubic use images
I prepared at https://codepen.io/osublake/full/vKaxxk (codepen page by Blake Bowen).
In those images, the blue curve is determined by the "centripetal parameterization",
the green curve shows the "uniform parameterization", the red curve follows the "chordal" solution.
