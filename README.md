## General Perspective

Catmull-Rom splines are a workhorse of computer graphics. Using the centripetal parameterization, they become a very handy general purpose tool for fast, attractive curvilinear blending. Often, they give interpoint "motion" a naturalistic feel.

## Use

A sequence of 2D, 3D .. nD points is required.  There is no limit on the number of coordinate dimensions.  The sequence of values
given as the first coordinate of each point becomes the abcissae (the `x` coordinate values).  The second values become the
ordinates.  When there are more than two coordinates comprising each point, the second coordinate is as the `y` coordinate value
(or whatever coordinate is identified with the axis that follows e.g. by the right-hand rule).

Each succesive coordinate of a point provides an additional ordinate sequence, with its corresponding coordinate axis.
The coordinate axes are treated as orthonormal and relatively independent of one another.  All ordinate sequences are
taken with respect to the same abcissae.  So, the arcs that connect successive `y`s are arcs hewn from a succession
of `(x_i, y_i)` ordered pairs and the arcs that connect successive `z`s are arcs hewn from a succession of `(x_i, z_i)`
ordered pairs.  It is easy to obtain arcs determined from _e.g._ the sequence of `(y_i, z_i)` pairs.  Just call the
`catmullrom` function with points that are generated with `collect(zip(ys, zs))`.

The point sequence may be provided as a vector of points or as a tuple of points.  The points themselves may be vectors of coordinate values or tuples of coordinate values.  While the points and their coordinates are manipulated internally, that occurs without altering any values or sequences you use.

A new point preceeds your first and another follows your last. |
| By appending a new first and a new last point, the resulting sequence starts and ends with your boundary points. | This just happens with the internal flow, unless you prefer another route. |


```
using CatmullRom, Plots

result = catmullrom(points, n_inbetween_points)  # your points, how many new points to place between adjacents
                                                 # result is a vector of coordinates, e.g. [xs, ys, zs]
plot(result...,)
```

When your points have nonuniform separation, or separation extents vary with coordinate dimension,
it is of benefit to allocate more of the new inbetween points where there are relatively greater
distances between your adjacent points.  The most appropriate measure for comparison and weighting
is interpoint arclength.  This package implements a well-behaved approximation to Catmull-Rom
arclengths appropriate to the centripetal parameterization.  You can use this directly.

```
using CatmullRom, Plots

result = catmullrom_byarc(points) # result is a vector of coordinates, e.g. [xs, ys, zs]
 
result = catmullrom_byarc(points, arcpoints_min=at_least, arcpoints_max=at_most)
                                  # specify the range of inbetween points used
xs, ys = result
plot(xs, ys)                      # plot(result...,)
```

If your points exist as separate coordinate vectors, aggregate them this way
`points = collect(zip(xs, ys, zs))`
